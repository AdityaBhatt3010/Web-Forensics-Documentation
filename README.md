## **1. Web Forensic Methodologies**  
Web forensics involves various techniques to analyze digital evidence related to web-based activities. The following methodologies are commonly used:  

### **a. Live Analysis**  
- Examining digital evidence in real-time while the system or device is operational.  
- Useful for incident response, detecting active threats, and monitoring ongoing attacks.  

### **b. Static Analysis**  
- Involves examining digital evidence in a non-operational state.  
- This includes analyzing stored files, logs, and databases without executing them.  

### **c. Dynamic Analysis**  
- Running digital artifacts in a controlled environment to observe their behavior.  
- Helps in understanding the functionality of malware or suspicious web applications.  

### **d. Network Forensics**  
- Analyzing network traffic to detect cybercrimes, security breaches, or unauthorized activities.  
- Tools like Wireshark and TCPDump are used to inspect network packets.  

### **e. Timeline Analysis**  
- Reconstructing a sequence of events based on timestamps from various digital artifacts.  
- Helps in forensic investigations to track user actions and system changes.

## **2. Web Evidence Collection**  
Web evidence collection is a systematic process of gathering, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence from various sources on the Internet.  

### **Sources of Web Evidence:**  
- **Websites** (HTML, JavaScript, CSS files)  
- **Web servers** (Server logs, databases)  
- **Other online platforms** (Social media, cloud storage)  

### **Types of Evidence Collected:**  
- **Web logs:** Record of user activity on websites.  
- **Cookies & Session Information:** Stores authentication tokens and browsing preferences.  
- **Other artifacts:** Metadata, cached pages, and downloaded files.

## **3. Web Forensic Process**  
Web forensics follows a structured process to ensure the integrity and authenticity of collected evidence.  

### **a. Evidence Identification**  
- Recognizing potential sources of digital evidence, such as web traffic, logs, and browser artifacts.  

### **b. Evidence Collection**  
- Capturing necessary data without altering its integrity.  
- Tools like FTK Imager and EnCase are used for forensic data collection.  

### **c. Evidence Preservation**  
- Ensuring that collected evidence remains unaltered and admissible in court.  
- Using hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-256) to verify data integrity.  

### **d. Evidence Examination and Analysis**  
- Analyzing collected data for patterns, anomalies, and suspicious activities.  
- Reverse engineering scripts, reconstructing deleted web pages, and identifying attack vectors.  

### **e. Reporting and Documentation**  
- Creating a detailed forensic report documenting findings, methodology, and conclusions.  
- Used for legal proceedings, cybersecurity audits, and forensic investigations.

## **4. Common Web Protocols**  
Web forensics often involves analyzing different network and web communication protocols:  

### **a. File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**  
- Used for transferring files between a client and a server.  
- Attackers may leave traces of malicious file transfers in FTP logs.  

### **b. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**  
- Used for sending and receiving email messages between email servers.  
- Forensics involves analyzing email headers, attachments, and phishing attempts.  

### **c. Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)**  
- Allows email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server.  
- Helps investigators access suspectâ€™s email communications.

## **5. Common Web Technologies**  
Understanding web technologies helps forensic investigators analyze digital artifacts effectively.  

### **a. Content Management Systems (CMS)**  
- Platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal manage web content.  
- Attackers may exploit CMS vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.  

### **b. Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**  
- Allow different applications to communicate over the web.  
- APIs can be exploited for data breaches, requiring forensic analysis.  

### **c. Web Standards and Specifications**  
- Organizations like **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** set guidelines for web security and accessibility.  
- Standards ensure secure implementation of web applications and services.

## **6. Techniques for Capturing Web Evidence**  
Different techniques are used to extract and analyze digital evidence from web activities.  

### **a. Browser Artifacts Capturing**  
- Browsers store various digital evidence, including:  
  - Cache files  
  - Cookies  
  - Browsing history  
  - Session data  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Web Historian  
  - BrowsingHistoryView  
  - Chrome Cache Viewer  

### **b. Remote Capture Tools**  
- Collects evidence from remote web servers or client devices.  
- Useful when direct access to the system is not available.  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Burp Suite  
  - Postman  

### **c. Capturing API Interactions**  
- Web applications use APIs for data exchange.  
- Monitoring API requests can reveal security vulnerabilities.  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Postman  
  - Burp Suite  

### **d. Capturing HTTP Headers and Requests**  
- Helps in understanding client-server communication.  
- Can be used to identify suspicious requests, hidden parameters, and malicious payloads.  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Fiddler  
  - Burp Suite
